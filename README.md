This is my personal website. Yup. 

I'm using the site as an excuse to learn and practice front-end stuff like [HAML](haml.info), [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), Ruby, and CSS and how they all work together. 
Also using [Middleman](middlemanapp.com) in development.

Any and all feedback is appreciated.
